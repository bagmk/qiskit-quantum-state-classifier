# qiskit-quantum-state-classifier
Pilote project testing a Monte Carlo simulation a quantum state classifier based on distance matrix computation. The classifier is applied on a set of separable highly entangled quantum states and uses either an ideal model of measurement count distributions or a front-end empirical model.
